# WithoutSvelte
### Engine ejs
I want to create a new Rest Api as ### ProjectNumberOne  you can see it here: https://github.com/Xasanboy-Dev/ProjectNumberOne  
But I can n't do it. Bacause I worked with module axius in ProjectNumberOne. In this project I need not a axius because all project will in one folder.
And if you can work with 'Engine' you need to Create a new Project byt very big (enormous).
And you can find me here:
